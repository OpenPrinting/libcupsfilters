#
# This file defines the font mappings used for Unicode/UTF-8 text printing
# through PDF.
#
# Each line consists of:
#
#   first last direction width normal bold italic bold-italic
#
# First and last are the first and last glyphs in the font mapping
# that correspond to that font; contrary to PostScript printing
# they only select the font. To find the glyph the complete unicode
# character will be looked up in the (3,1) resp. (3,0) cmap of the 
# TrueType font. The glyph values are hexadecimal.
#
# Direction is the string "ltor" or "rtol", indicating left-to-right or
# right-to-left text.
#
# Width is the string "single" or "double"; double means that the glyphs
# are twice as wide as ASCII characters in the Courier typeface.
#
# "Normal", "bold", "italic", and "bold-italic" are the typefaces to use
# for each presentation.  If characters are only available in a single
# style then only one typeface should be listed (e.g. "Symbol")
#
# Each font that is listed will be used (and downloaded if needed) when
# printing.
