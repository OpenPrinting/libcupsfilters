# Libcupsfilters v2.0.0 Installation Guide


## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for compiling and installing the OpenPrinting libcupsfilters version 2.0.0 from source code. For detailed information about libcupsfilters, refer to "README.md", and for a complete change log, see "CHANGES.md".

### Important Note
For non-PDF printers (excluding Mac OS X users), you must install Ghostscript with specific drivers ("cups", "pwgraster", "appleraster", "urf", "pclm", "pclm8", "pdfwrite", "pdfimage24", "pdfimage32", "pdfimage8") after installing CUPS and before installing libcupsfilters.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites for Compilation
- ANSI-compliant C and C++ compilers (mostly written in C, some components in C++)
- make program
- POSIX-compliant shell (/bin/sh)
- autoconf, autopoint, automake, libtool for ./autogen.sh
- CUPS devel files (version 2.2.2 or higher)
- Poppler (with --enable-poppler-cpp) devel files for pdftoraster
- fontconfig devel files for texttopdf
- liblcms (liblcms2 recommended) devel files for color management
- QPDF (11.0 or higher, 11.4.0 recommended) devel files

### Additional Binaries for Non-PDF Printers
- Ghostscript 10.01.1 or higher (with specific output devices support)
or
- MuPDF (version 1.15 or higher)

### Optional Features
- libdbus, libjpeg, libpng, libtiff, libexif devel files for various format supports
- Dejavu Sans fonts for internal test suite

### Compiler and Make Tools
- Tested with GNU compiler tools and bash
- Compatible with GNU make and other versions (BSD users should use GNU make)

## Compiling the GIT Repository Code
- The GIT repository doesn't include a pre-built configure script.
- Use GNU autoconf (2.65 or higher) to create it:
  ```
  ./autogen.sh
  ```

## Configuration
- Use the "configure" script in the main directory:
  ```
  ./configure
  ```
- Default installation path is "/usr".
- For custom installation path, use the "--prefix" option:
  ```
  ./configure --prefix=/some/directory
  ```
- Use `./configure --help` for all configuration options.
- Set environment variables for libraries in non-default locations.

## Building the Software
- Run `make` (or `gmake` for BSD systems) to build the software.

## Installing the Software
- After building, install the software with:
  ```
  make install
  ```
- For BSD systems:
  ```
  gmake install
  ```

## Runtime Dependencies
- dBUS provider (dbus-broker/dbus-daemon) and colord for dBUS support
- Ghostscript or MuPDF based on configuration
- A monospace font (e.g., liberation-mono-fonts) for texttopdf

## Packaging for Operating System Distributions
- libcupsfilters is supported for CUPS from version 2.2.2.
- For earlier CUPS versions (1.5.x, required since 1.6.x), use cups-filters 1.x.
